Hadoop is an open-source framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models.
It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage.
The Hadoop framework consists of the Hadoop Common, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and the Hadoop MapReduce programming model.
Hadoop enables applications to work with thousands of nodes and petabytes of data.
MapReduce is the processing layer of Hadoop.
It divides the task into small parts that can be executed on different nodes.
This makes Hadoop highly efficient, scalable, and fault-tolerant.
Many companies use Hadoop to handle massive amounts of data daily.
